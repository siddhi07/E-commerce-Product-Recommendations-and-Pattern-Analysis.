        "## The Apriori Model\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Apriori Algorithm is the foundation of market basket analysis and is used to find items frequently bought together. This is very useful for retailers because:\n",
        "    - Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.\n",
        "    - Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.\n",
        "    - Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.\n",
        "    - X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.\n",
        "    \n",
        "## Affinity analysis\n",
        "- Affinity analysis is a data analysis and data mining technique that discovers **co-occurrence relationships** among activities performed by (or recorded about) specific individuals or groups.\n",
        "- In general, this can be applied to any process where agents can be uniquely identified and information about their activities can be recorded. In retail, affinity analysis is used to **perform market basket analysis**, in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behavior of customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Association Rule Mining\n",
        "- Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items.\n",
        "- It works by looking for **combinations of items that occur together frequently** in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Apriori Algorithm\n",
        "- Apriori is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over relational databases.\n",
        "- It proceeds by identifying the **frequent individual items** in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\n",
        "    - **Support**: This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.\n",
        "    - **Confidence**: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.\n",
        "    - **Lift**: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased while controlling for how popular item Y is."

        "**Association rules analysis** is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.</br>\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Measure 1: Support.** This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In the Table above, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.</br>\n",
        " - **Measure 2: Confidence.** This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In Table 1, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.</br>\n",
        " - **Measure 3: Lift.** This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.</br>\n"
